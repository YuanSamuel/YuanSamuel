Heyo! My name is Samuel Yuan, and I'm an incoming freshman at UT Austin majoring in <a href="https://csb.utexas.edu/">Computer Science and Business Honors</a>.

I mostly work with Flutter and Firebase but have experience with technologies like React, TailwindCSS, Svelte, GraphQL, and more

Currently, I'm a developer at <a href="https://www.petcodeusa.com/">PetCode</a> but am open to any opportunitiesâ€”feel free to reach out!

You can reach me at syuan@utexas.edu and find more about me at samuelyuan.com.
