Heyo! My name is Samuel Yuan, and I'm a freshman at UT Austin majoring in <a href="https://csb.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science and Business Honors</a>.

I mostly work with Flutter and Firebase but have experience with technologies like React, TailwindCSS, Svelte, and GraphQL.

Currently, I'm a developer at <a href="https://www.petcodeusa.com/"  target="_blank">PetCode</a> but am open to any opportunitiesâ€”feel free to reach out!

You can reach me by email at syuan@utexas.edu, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuansamuel/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> at @yuansamuel,  and find more about me at <a href="https://samuelyuan.com"  target="_blank">samuelyuan.com<a>.
